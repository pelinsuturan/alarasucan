## ⚙️ Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration. This keeps sensitive data secure and allows for easy adjustments between development and production environments.

* `PORT`: The port on which the server will run. (Default: 3000)
* `NODE_ENV`: The application environment. Set to `production` for deployed versions.

**For Production (e.g., on Render):** These variables should be set in the "Environment" section of your hosting service's dashboard. **Do not** commit your `.env` file to version control.
